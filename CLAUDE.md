# NoteFusion — monorepo

Transcribes live/recorded music into **Tonic Solfa** (movable-do) + **staff notation**.
Requirements: `docs/NoteFusion_PRD.docx` and `docs/NoteFusion_TRD.docx` (extract text
before reading; they are the source of truth for features and stack decisions).

## Architecture (three tiers)

Clients talk **only** to the C# Web API; the API is the single gateway to the Python ML
service. Reference coding patterns come from `Model-Carbon/SbzFarms`.

- **`src/` — C# .NET 10 Web API** (main backend): modular monolith, clean architecture,
  headless (same image serves mobile now, web later). Layers point inward:
  `Shared ← Core ← Application ← Infrastructure ← Api`. Postgres via EF Core; JWT access +
  rotating refresh tokens.
- **`server/` — Python FastAPI ML worker**: Basic Pitch / ONNX CPU inference, single-worker
  job queue. Internal only — never called by a client. Audio deleted after each job.
- **`mobile/` — React Native + Expo** (SDK 52, TypeScript strict): the cross-platform
  client. Dark-themed, JWT refresh interceptor, expo-notifications push.

> The old native `.NET 10 for Android` head was retired in the pivot; there is no
> `NoteFusion.App` project. Don't reintroduce Android-native or MAUI code.

## Rules that still hold

- Clean architecture: dependencies point inward; only `NoteFusion.Api` composes the app.
  Feature folders inside Application, `DependencyInjection.cs` per layer, `Result`/`Error`
  for expected failures, `Guard` for programmer errors.
- **Solfa engine (`src/NoteFusion.Core/Solfa`) is the product's core IP.** Movable-do: doh
  derives from the key (la-based for minor). Key change = re-label, never re-transcribe.
  Every change there needs unit tests. The Python worker mirrors this engine — keep the
  two in lock-step (see `server/app/pipeline` and its `_parse_key_override`).
- Wire contract is **camelCase**; the C# `ApiError` envelope is `{code, message, details?}`.
  The mobile `src/api/types.ts` mirrors the C# DTOs exactly — change both together.
- Config is env-driven: nested keys use `__` (e.g. `Database__Host`, `TranscriptionApi__BaseUrl`).
  The same image runs in dev and compose with only env changes.

## Commands

```bash
# C# API — build & test (no DB needed; tests use SQLite in-memory)
dotnet build NoteFusion.slnx -c Release
dotnet test  NoteFusion.slnx

# Python ML worker
cd server && python -m pytest -q

# Mobile — strict type-check
cd mobile && npm run lint          # tsc --noEmit

# Whole backend stack
docker compose up --build          # api :5080, transcriber :8000, db :5432
```
